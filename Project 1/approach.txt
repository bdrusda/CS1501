The user's previously entered words are stored in a file called user_history.txt.
    Duplicates of words are allowed
Upon each program execution, an ArrayList is created that makes Word_Freq objects
    Each time a new word is introduced, it is added to the ArrayList
    Each time that a duplicate is encountered, the frequency field in the object is increased
    The ArrayList is then sorted by frequency from greatest to least
    Words are added to a User DLB trie consecutively to give higher frequency words higher priority
User entries are appended to the text file

This approach allows the use of prioritizing alphabetized dictionary results to be rolled over into prioritizing frequency-sorted user results.
